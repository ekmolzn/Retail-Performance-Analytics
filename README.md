# 📊 Retail Performance Analytics: API Data Pull to Python & SQL to Power BI

**End-to-end analytics project covering data ingestion, transformation, and visualization for actionable retail insights.**

---

## 🚀 Project Summary

In this project, I built a complete data pipeline that pulls retail performance data via API, processes it using Python and SQL, and visualizes key business metrics in an interactive Power BI dashboard. This simulates a real-world workflow and highlights my ability to move from raw data to business decision support.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (requests, pandas, SQLite, BASH shell commands) – API data extraction, transformation
- **SQLite / SQL** – Data modeling, joins, aggregations, calculated columns, table creation
- **Power BI** (Star schema data modeling, calculated columns & measures)– Visual analytics and dashboarding
- **Power Query** – For connecting SQL database to Power BI

---

## 📌 Business Questions Addressed

- How do **sales, profit, and margin** vary by **region**, **product category**, and **discount type**?
- Which segments are **underperforming despite high discount rates**?
- What is the impact of **discount strategy on profitability**?
- How do **realization rate** and **ROD (return on discount)** differ across years and customer segments?

---

## 🔍 Project Flow

1. **API Data Pull** – Retail dataset retrieved programmatically with Python
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation** – Using pandas to structure the data for SQL loading
3. **SQLite Database Creation** – Structured data stored in normalized SQL tables
4. **Descriptive Analytics with SQL** – Exploratory queries, aggregations, trend identification
5. **Power BI Reporting** – Dynamic visuals and interactive filtering for stakeholder insights

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard includes:

- Profitability breakdown by **region**, **category**, and **discount type**
- Trend lines and KPIs for **realization rate**, **profit margin**, and **ROD**
- Interactive **scatter plots** showing relationships between discount and profitability
- Filtering by **year**, **product line**, and **segment**
